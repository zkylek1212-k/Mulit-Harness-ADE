# Agent Instructions

Canonical cross-agent memory is `.project-memory/`.

## Startup — run this ONE command first, every session

```bash
bash .project-memory/status.sh
```

It prints tier-1 memory (`INDEX.md` + `handoff.md`) and reports whether the branch is behind the
remote. Do not read those two files separately — the command already gave you their contents.

Then:
1. Inspect `git status --short` and `git branch --show-current`.
2. Summarise the current context in <=3 bullets.
3. Read `.project-memory/PROTOCOL.md` on first entry to this repo, for Git/worktree/merge tasks,
   for memory-file changes, or when the rules are unclear.
4. Read `STATE.md` / `DECISIONS.md` only when the task needs macro status or architecture history.

## Before finishing

Apply the memory-update criteria in `PROTOCOL.md`: rewrite `handoff.md` when the work meets the
threshold; skip it entirely for read-only questions, trivial explanations, and no-change reviews.

Then commit the memory yourself — an uncommitted handoff does not exist for anyone else:

```bash
bash .project-memory/commit-handoff.sh "docs(memory): <one-line summary>"
```

It is pathspec-limited to memory files, so the user's staged source changes are left untouched.
It pushes only when `MEM_AUTOPUSH=1`; otherwise say clearly that the handoff is not pushed yet.

## Never

- Auto pull/rebase/merge/reset/force-push without user authorization. `git fetch` is read-only and fine.
- Commit the user's SOURCE code on your own initiative — committing shared memory is fine, that is not.
- Commit secrets, tokens, passwords, API keys, or private keys.
- Rewrite historical decisions — supersede them instead.

## Current shared memory (tier 1 - auto-generated, do not edit here)

You already have the current handoff below. Do NOT re-read `.project-memory/handoff.md`.
Read `STATE.md` / `DECISIONS.md` / `PROTOCOL.md` only on demand.
For the freshest copy plus a remote-drift check, run `bash .project-memory/status.sh`.

# Latest Handoff

- Agent: Claude Code
- Updated: 2026-10-09 Asia/Taipei
- v0.1.40 released (Windows). User authorised push, merge of PR #41/#42 and the release in one request.
- Architecture: DEC-011, two independent apps in one repo; no shared runtime imports or npm workspace. Windows users take priority.

## Done this session
- Linux PR #41 CI fixed by 3469c9e (Electron SUID sandbox step in .github/workflows/linux-app.yml); runs 37816334970 and 37870095383 (on 9cb042d) green. Merged as 349774e; Issue #40 closed.
- Phone Cowork PR #42 merged as 0885cda: Cowork tile per workspace (list, new meeting, timeline, per-phase actions); `invokeCowork` + `coworkEvents` in main/ipc/cowork.ts serve the Remote Bridge.
- Release PR #43 (release/v0.1.40: package.json/lock 0.1.40, CHANGELOG, README phone Cowork bullet en/zh) merged as 851b185.
- Tag v0.1.40 → 851b185, release marked Latest with setup.exe, blockmap, portable.zip, latest.yml (version 0.1.40). Built via `npm run release` from master.
- Validation on merged master before release: typecheck, check-cowork.mts, check-remote.mts, build, `electron scripts/check-remote-cowork.cjs` all passed; release.ps1 typecheck + electron-builder passed.

## Next / limits
- Linux linux-v0.1.0 PUBLISHED (user-authorised): tag created via GitHub API on master b98dc0d (local git was hung); CI run 37874886216 build+publish green; prerelease with AppImage/deb/tar.gz x64; releases/latest still v0.1.40. Next Linux release: bump apps/linux/package.json, then tag linux-vX.Y.Z (must match).
- Main workspace git: .git/index went OneDrive cloud-only and hung (~160 unkillable git status). Needs full OneDrive quit or reboot, then `git reset -q` to rebuild the index. Commits this session were made with a temporary GIT_INDEX_FILE outside OneDrive. `.git` has conflict copies from machine GG5275-NB — OneDrive syncs .git across machines; consider moving the repo out of OneDrive.
- Phone Cowork: no real iPhone ↔ desktop E2E yet; a meeting started on desktop shows in the phone list only after reload/reconnect; not ported to apps/linux (DEC-011 manual port).
- Cleanup done (user-authorised): 5 merged worktrees removed (cowork-ui, ime-fix, mobile-cowork, release-v0.1.35, release-v0.1.39; junctions removed first), 31 merged local branches deleted, all 33 remote branches deleted (all ahead_by=0 vs master; GitHub now has only master).
- Kept (not merged): local backup/master-memory-2026-10-01, chore/release-v0.1.27/30/31, test/pr-35-36-37 + its worktree C:/Users/milan.chang/AppData/Local/Temp/agent-workbench-test-pr35-37 (5 uncommitted source edits).
- Other Linux distributions, ARM64, real deb install and complete agent-provider/phone remote E2E remain unverified. Linux updater checks the newest 100 releases.
- WSL verification cache: /home/milanchang/.cache/agent-workbench-linux-verification.
- Temp/ and three phone screenshots remain untracked and untouched in the main workspace.
- History: archive/handoff-2026-10-09-pr41-pr42-before-merge.md, archive/handoff-2026-10-08-linux-local-verification-before-pr.md.
